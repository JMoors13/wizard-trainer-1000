# Wizard Trainer 1000

## Concept

Just a 'proof-of-concept' idea that I can flesh out as a terminal text-style game. At this point, you can create and save wizards, which you complete daily tasks for them.
Daily tasks are those of which a wizard in this world would do, ie. forage, learn spells and experiment with found items. The objective of the wizard is to level them and
shape them into the wizard the user wants. By the choice of each action, the user is foricng the wizard down a path and forming the characteristics and skills of this
wizard.

## Currently In Game

- Create, load and save wizard.
- Perform activities and level corresponding skills
- World (local to the user) spells and properties discovered.

## To Add

- Discovered properties available to all wizards created.
- Method of learning actions that wizards can experiment on items with.
- Create unique ways of learning spells rather than purely level
